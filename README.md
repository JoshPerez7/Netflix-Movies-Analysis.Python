# Netflix Movies Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of movies on Netflix, focusing on movies released in the 1990s. The goal is to understand trends and patterns in the data, such as the most frequent movie duration and the number of short action movies released in the 1990s.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze Netflix movies data to extract meaningful insights and trends about movies released in the 1990s. Specifically, the project aims to:

1. Identify the most frequent movie duration during the 1990s.
2. Count the number of short action movies (less than 90 minutes) released in the 1990s.

By achieving these goals, we aim to better understand the characteristics and trends of movies from this nostalgic decade, which can help inform future production decisions for a company specializing in nostalgic styles.

## Conclusion

In this project, we conducted an exploratory data analysis on Netflix movies data, with a particular focus on movies released in the 1990s. Our analysis revealed two key insights:

1. The most frequent movie duration for movies released in the 1990s was 94 minutes. This consistency in runtime suggests that filmmakers of the era often aimed for a length that was manageable for audiences while still providing enough time for storytelling.

2. There were only 7 short action movies (less than 90 minutes) released in the 1990s. This finding indicates that while action movies were popular, shorter runtimes were less common for this genre, likely due to the need for extended action sequences and character development.

These insights can help production companies specializing in nostalgic styles to better understand the characteristics and trends of movies from the 1990s. By incorporating these elements into new projects, they can enhance the nostalgic appeal and authenticity of their productions, resonating with audiences who have a fondness for this iconic decade.

Overall, this analysis has provided valuable information on the typical movie durations and genre-specific trends of the 1990s, which can inform future production decisions and strategies.
